# Pygame-Game

Create a Simple Pygame Game

Your program should meet the following requirements:

1. Class Structure:
    - Implement at least three classes.
    - Ensure that at least one class includes animation when an object moves.
    - Enable control of object actions through key presses for at least one class.

2. Collision Detection:
    - Utilize the `.colliderect()` method in at least one class to determine if an object has made contact with another object.

3. Sprite Group:
    - Incorporate at least one `Group` from the `pygame.sprite` module to organize and manage sprites.

4. Collision Function:
    - Use the `pygame.sprite.spritecollide()` function to detect if an object makes contact with any other objects stored in the group.

5. Game Loop:
    - Establish a game loop to manage continuous gameplay.

6. Winning and Losing Conditions:
    - Define a clear goal for the player to achieve victory.
    - Implement mechanisms through which the player can lose.
